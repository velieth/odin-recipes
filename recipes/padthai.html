    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Pad Thai is an extremely delicious noodle based dish from SEA. As a personal favorite, I can't wait to make this one at home.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>10 ounces thin rice noodles</li>
        <li>3 tbsp oil, divided</li>
        <li>1 lb boneess chicken beasts, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>1 cup fresh bean sprouts</li>
        <li>1/2 cup shredded carrots</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>3 eggs, whisked</li>
        <li>3 green onions</li>
        <li>chopped peanuts, red pepper, and fresh lime to taste</li>
        <li>1/3 cup brown sugar</li>
        <li>1/4 cup fish sauce</li>
        <li>2 tbsp tamarind concentrate</li>
        <li>2 tbsp soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 fresh lime, squeezed</li>
        <li>1/4 cup red pepper flakes</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Make the sauce. Whisk all ingredients together in a medium bowl (or shake together in a mason jar) until completely combined. Set aside until ready to use.</li>
        <li>Cook the noodles. Cook the noodles al dente according to package instructions.  Drain the noodles in a strainer, then rinse with cold water briefly to halt their cooking.  Toss briefly with one tablespoon oil to prevent the noodles from sticking.</li>
        <li>Cook the chicken (or see other protein options below). Meanwhile, heat 1 tablespoon oil in a large sauté pan or wok over high heat. Add the chicken and sauté for 3-5 minutes, tossing occasionally, until the chicken is cooked through. Use a slotted spoon to transfer the chicken to a clean plate and set aside.</li>
        <li>Cook the veggies. Add the remaining 1 tablespoon oil to the sauté pan, along with the bean sprouts, carrots, and garlic.  Sauté for 2 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
        <li>Cook the eggs. Push the veggies to one side of the pan and add the whisked eggs on the other side.  Cook the eggs until scrambled, stirring often.</li>
        <li>Put it all together. Now add everything back in with the eggs and veggies — the cooked noodles, cooked chicken, sauce and green onions. Give the mixture a good toss until everything is evenly coated in the sauce.  Remove pan from heat.</li>
        <li>Serve. Serve immediately, sprinkled with lots of crushed peanuts, extra crushed red pepper flakes (if desired) and a good squeeze of fresh lime juice. Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
